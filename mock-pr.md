  - Added position-aware tokenization.
  - Normalized TF-IDF vectors.
- **Impact**: Improved clustering accuracy and consistency across datasets.

### 2. **Integration of Multiple Clustering Algorithms**
- **Description**: Implemented and integrated clustering algorithms, including DBSCAN, OPTICS, HDBSCAN, KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and GMM.
- **Implementation**:
  - Developed individual clustering methods in `cluster.py`.
  - Added dynamic parameter optimization (e.g., `eps` for DBSCAN).
  - Supported ensemble clustering with a voting mechanism.

### 3. **Ensemble Clustering**
- **Description**: Combined results from multiple clustering algorithms to provide robust consensus labels.
- **Implementation**:
  - Developed a voting-based ensemble clustering mechanism.

### 4. **Mistral Model Integration**
- **Description**: Added support for the Mistral model via the Ollama API for parsing logs and benchmarking.
- **Implementation**:
  - Extended `Parser` class to support OpenAI, Together, and Mistral.
  - Developed benchmarking framework to compare Normalized Edit Distance (NED), Parsing Accuracy (PA), and Parsing Time.

### 5. **Detailed Log Analysis Reports**
- **Log Level Summaries**: Generated detailed summaries of log levels (e.g., INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and provided an optional bar chart for visualization.
  - **Implementation**: Parsed logs, supported bar chart generation, and saved outputs in `.out` and `.csv` formats.
  - **Impact**: Simplified system health monitoring and enabled faster issue identification.
- **Error Tagging System**: Automatically tagged recurring high-frequency error messages as high-priority issues.
  - **Implementation**: Configured tagging threshold in YAML, highlighted high-priority issues, and used regex patterns to identify critical errors.

### 6. **Clustering Comparison and Voting System**
- **Description**: Enabled comparison of multiple clustering methods based on metrics like Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Score, and Davies-Bouldin Score.
- **Implementation**:
  - Ranked algorithms by performance on sample datasets.
  - Supported visualizations for comparative metrics.
  - Added configuration options for method selection.
